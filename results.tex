The rotating chemical wave in the BZ reaction medium can get anchored into the
boundary of the glassbead and form a very stable pinned wave, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:unpinning_images}~b.  A similar sitauation occurs in the
numerical simulation of the model equations, where the spiral wave can getrs
anchored to the obstacle in the domain. It is known that this wave can be
unpinned with an electric field~\cite{Amrutha,???}. 
Here we employ the circularly polarized electric field (CPEF) using two
cross-electrodes, as described before. The CPEF can unpin the wave if the
amplitude of the electric field is above a certain threshold value ($E_{the}$),
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:unpinning_images}~c.  The direction of the electric
field is indicated by an arrow. Similar unpinning
is also seen in the model equations(Fig.~\ref{fig:unpinning_images}~d). To
understand the unpinning process we measure the location at which the wave
leaves the obstacle. This can be quantified by measuring the phase of the
spiral tip on the obstacle boundary. The phase of the spiral is the angle of
the spiral tip, measured in degrees from the $+x$-axis along the anticlockwise
direction. The phase of the spiral when we start the CPEF is denoted by
$\phi_0$ and the phase when the spiral leaves the boundary is denoted by
$\phi_u$. We can also calculate the instanenous direction of the electric
field, and this is denoted by the angle $\theta_E$. The direction of the spiral
is along the tangent at the obstacle, and this direction is denoted by
${\hat{r}}_{t}$.

We observe that, in the experiments and simulations, the unpinning phase
depends linearly on $\phi_0$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:unpinning_EthA}.  The
unpinning angle also depends on the chiorality of the spiral, the frequency of
CPEF. We define the pacing ratio, $p$ as the ratio of the frequency of the
CPEF($\omega_{cp}$) to that of the spiral($\omega_s$), {i.e.,} \( p=
\frac{\omega_{cp}}{\omega_{s}}\). We have varied $p$ from ??? to 4, as above 4
the field has no effect(???). Figure~\ref{fig:unpinning_EthB} shows unpinning
angle as a function of $p$ for various initial conditions in the experiments
and the simulations. It is seen that unpinning fails as $p$ approaches 1, for
most values of $\phi_0$. 

These results can be understood in the light of our recent work with DC
electric fields~\cite{Amrutha}. We had found that, the elctric field exerts a
retarding force of the chemical wave front and this force is maximum when the
field direction is along the direction of the wavefront. The direction of the
wavefront here is the direction of the tangent vector at the spiral tip. For a
CPEF this condition is satisfied when 
\begin{eqnarray}
	\phi_u &=& \frac{p \phi_0+ 90}{p-1} ; p>1 \\
	\phi_u &=& \frac{270-p \phi_0}{1-p} ; p<1  
\label{eq:Eth}
\end{eqnarray}

This equation is used to plot the theoretical solid curves used in Figs.~\ref{fig:unpinning_EthA} and
\ref{fig:unpinning_EthB}.   

When $p$=1, the condition for unpinning is met only for a small range of intial
conditions. When $E=E_{th}$ the wave can be unpinned only when the
$\theta_E-\phi_0 = 90$. For all other initial phases of spiral, the wave cannot
be unpinned by the CPEF.  

Following the mechanism at E = $E_{th}$, the unpinning for a field strength
greater than $E_{th}$ must occur when the component of $\vec{E}$ along
$\hat{r_t}$ reaches the critical threshold, $E_{th}$. i.e, when the scalar
product of ${\vec{E}}$ and ${\hat{r}}_{t}$ is equal to or greater than
$E_{th}$. This condition gives a window of possible spiral unpinning phase
$\phi_{u}$ in terms of $\phi_{0}$, p, E and $E_{th}$ as in
equation.\ref{eq:phiu_range}.

For overdrive pacing with $p>1$, the unpinning phase window is given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{p \phi_0+ {\sin^{-1}}(\frac{E_{th}}{E})}{p-1}   \leq \phi_u \leq \frac{p \phi_0+\pi -{\sin^{-1}}(\frac{E_{th}}{E})}{p-1}
\label{eq:overdrive}
\end{equation}
with a width $\Delta\phi_u = \frac{\pi - 2 \sin^{-1}(\frac{E_{th}}{E})}{p-1}$.
As the CPEF approaches the spiral wave from behind, this condition is satisfied for the lowerbound of this range. But when $\phi_0$ falls within this range, the wave unpins with a fixed delay, as also was observed with DC electric field. To demonstrate these result we plot ($\phi_u-\theta_E$) as a function of $\phi_0$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:unpinningE>Eth}. Note that $\phi_u$ has a steady value when $\phi_0$ is outside the range given by Eq.~\ref{eq:overdrive}.

For underdrive pacing i.e, for $p<1$, the unpinning phase window is 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\pi+ {\sin^{-1}}(\frac{E_{th}}{E})-p \phi_0}{1-p}   \leq \phi_u \leq \frac{2\pi-p \phi_0-{\sin^{-1}}(\frac{E_{th}}{E})}{1-p}
\label{eq:underdrive}
\end{equation}
The width of this window is $\Delta\phi_u = \frac{\pi - 2 \sin^{-1}(\frac{E_{th}}{E})}{1-p}$. These results are plotted in Fig.

\fi
For p = 1, unpinning happens only if the following condition is satisfied.
\begin{equation}
\pi+ \sin^{-1}(\frac{E_{th}}{E})  \leq \phi_0 \leq 2\pi-\sin^{-1}(\frac{E_{th}}{E})
\label{eq:p=1}
\end{equation} 
Thus for $p=1$ the range of initial phases that lead to
unpinning increase with $E_{th}$. Fig.\ref{fig:E_p1}a shows the initial spiral
phases that lead to successful unpinning as a function of $\frac{E}{E_{th}}$.
