The mechanism of spiral wave unpinning in the BZ reaction with an applied rotating electric field is investigated by varying the pacing ratio, initial spiral phase, and field strength. Forced retardation of the pinned spiral wave by the electric field, while propagating away from the anode, induces unpinning. The unpinning occurs within the limits of the unpinning phase window calculated using the derived analytical formulae. The experimental observations are verified using the numerical simulations performed with the Oregonator model.

%\section{Introduction}
The Belousov-Zhabotinski(BZ) reaction has served as the prototype of a large
class of systems that display excitation waves, including the waves of action
potentials seen in the heart~\cite{Luther2011}, brain~\cite{Huang2004}, retina~\cite{???},
and waves of communication in the social amoeba dictystelium~\cite{???}.  
Chemical excitation waves in the BZ reaction exhibit spatio-temporal 
patterns such as expanding target waves~\cite{zhang2019stability} or rotating spiral
waves~\cite{zykov2018spiral}, whose appearance and dynamics are strikingly
similar to such waves in other media~\cite{sinha2014patterns}.  Recently there
has been a renewed interest in this pattern forming system because of the
active nature of the chemical waves: their wavefronts are electrically
charged~\cite{Amrutha,steinbock1992electric}, the droplets of chemical reaction in an oily medium
can move by itself~\cite{jin2017chemotaxis, ryabchun2022run}.

A characteristic feature of excitation waves in all types of media is their
tendency to pin to heterogeneities in the
system~\cite{sutthiopad2015propagation, lim2006spiral,Zemlin2012, Shajahan:07}. This is especially
pertinent in cardiac tissue since stable pinned rotating waves can be
pathological and difficult to control~\cite{Gray2011, Bittihn2010}. Several
groups have proposed methods for controlling such pinned waves using either
pulsed electric field~\cite{Luther2011} or, more recently, circularly
polarized electric field~\cite{Feng2014, pan2016removal,feng2022removal}. It is
observed that chemical waves are also prone to pinning~\cite{???} and they can
also be unpinned using electric field~\cite{Amrutha,???}. However, there is an
essential distinction between the chemical wave and the waves in physiological
tissue. In the latter, the electric does not affect the excitation wave
directly, instead they unpin by inducing secondary excitations from the
heterogeneities~\cite{pumir2007wave}. In the chemical medium, on the other hand,
the wavefront
contains charged ions such as $Br^-$ and $HBrO^+$, which can be moved by
electric field~\cite{Amrutha,jimenez2013electric,???}. The electric field in a
chemical medium exerts an advective force directly on the wavefront. Such an electric force on the wave is not reported in the physiological tissue. It is
also observed that the electric force acting on the chemical wave is
asymmetrical- it acts on the wave as it moves away from the anode.   

Recently it is proposed that circularly polarized electric fields(CPEF) are
more efficient in controlling cardiac excitation
waves~\cite{feng2022removal,punacha2020theory,Feng2014}. Since then, there has
been much interest in controlling generic excitation waves using
CPEF~\cite{pan2016removal}, and it was also implemented to control spiral waves
in the B reaction~\cite{chen2009synchronization,ji2013experimental}. Numerical studies in reaction-diffusion models show that a rotating CPEF can synchronize the spiral frequency~\cite{chen2009synchronization} and make a chiral selection~\cite{li2013chiral}.
A co-rotating CPEF can induce a maximum spiral drift, but a counter-rotation
locks the drift~\cite{chen2006drift}. 
So far, we have not seen any experimental reports of unpinning excitation
waves, either in the chemical
medium or the cardiac tissue.  While there is a good understanding of how CPEF
affects pinned cardiac excitation waves~\cite{punacha2020theory} there have yet
to be studies on the
mechanism of CPEF on the chemical waves. The chemical wave is being controlled
by a rotating force, which can only retard the wave. Here the electric field is
chasing the chemical wave, but the field can only `catch' the wave from behind.
Moreover, the CPEF can only move at fixed
speed, and if it fails to halt the wave and overtakes it, it has to come back
again to act on it. We are unaware of any other physical situation 
similar to this.

%Because of this direct interaction between the chemical wave and the electric field
%Chemical waves in the oscillating BZ reaction are being studied intensively because of their applicability in various interdisciplinary areas, including the chemical computing~\cite{gorecki2022information} and the self-propelled motion~\cite{jin2017chemotaxis, ryabchun2022run}. The BZ reaction models the excitable media~\cite{sinha2014patterns}.The tip of a rotating spiral wave can pin to inhomogeneities present in the medium. Pinning alters the wave parameters such as the wave period, wavelength, and velocity depending on the size of the pinning obstacle~\cite{lim2006spiral, sutthiopad2015propagation}. An applied electric field can achieve unpinning of pinned spirals from the inhomogeneities~\cite{jimenez2013electric,punacha2020theory}. 
%Application of external electric field to the excitable systems, especially to the chemical and biological systems, can have a sensitive control over the wave dynamics~\cite{steinbock1992electric,bittihn2012negative,feng2022removal}.

%Field-induced unpinning of spiral waves in excitable cardiac tissue occurs due
%to the secondary wave emission~\cite{pumir2007wave,Bittihn2010} from the
%pinning obstacle. However, an applied electric field does not induce wave
%emission in the BZ reaction. The variations in the chemical wave dynamics in an
%applied electric field are correlated with the oriented movement of ionic
%species in the medium.
%So the mechanism of spiral unpinning is quite different in the chemical excitable medium. A slowdown in the spiral velocity due to the electric force leads to unpinning of a pinned spiral tip in a DC electric field~\cite{Amrutha}. In such cases, the field is static. But in a rotating electric field, the spiral and the field rotate with specific frequencies.
%Numerical studies in reaction-diffusion models show that a rotating CPEF can synchronize the spiral frequency~\cite{chen2009synchronization} and make a chiral selection~\cite{li2013chiral}.
%A co-rotating CPEF can induce a maximum spiral drift, but a counter-rotation locks the drift~\cite{chen2006drift}. Unpinning of two~\cite{punacha2020theory} and three-dimensional~\cite{pan2016removal} vortices is also reported in the cardiac models using the CPEF. The only experimental study of CPEF in the BZ reaction is reported by Ji et al. \cite{ji2013experimental}. 
%The control of spiral turbulence obtained in the BZ reaction with CPEF is explained based on frequency synchronization. 
 
%for the first time to our knowledge, the unpinning of a spiral wave with the circularly polarised electric field (CPEF) in the BZ reaction is reported. We will address the mechanism of spiral unpinning and formulate it analytically.
In this paper, we study the unpinning of chemical waves using CPEF in
experiments as well as in a mathematical model of the BZ reaction. The
mechanism of spiral wave unpinning in the BZ reaction with an applied rotating
electric field is investigated by varying the pacing ratio, initial spiral
phase, and field strength. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the wave
unpins when the direction of the spiral is parallel to the electric field
vector. Based on this hypothesis, we predict the unpinning angle as a function
of the initial position of the spiral wave, the frequency, and the strength of
the electric field. We find excellent agreement with experimental data and
numerical results.

\section{Conclusions}
	NEED TO EDIT\\

The electric force induces retardation in the propagation of a pinned spiral, which eventually leads to the unpinning of the spiral if the field possesses a threshold amplitude. 
The migration of negative bromide ions towards the anode causes a slowdown in the wave speed during the cycle of spiral rotation towards the cathode.
For any field strength greater than the threshold, the unpinning occurs when the electric field component along the tangential direction of spiral propagation reaches the critical threshold.
The unpinning demands a minimum interaction between the spiral and the field vector in an alignment in which the anode follows the spiral tip.
$\phi_u$ always comes within the unpinning phase window predicted by the mathematical conditions for any field strength greater than the threshold. Unpinning happens at a spiral phase, which comes immediately after the required interaction between the spiral and the field.
According to the equations, $\phi_u$ depends on p, E and $\phi_0$. These parameters fundamentally affect the interaction between the field vector and the spiral. 
Unpinning is possible for CPEF with underdrive pacing and p = 1 for a particular range of $\phi_0$. To get unpinning for p = 1, the initial position of the spiral must be ahead of the anode as obtained from equation.\ref{eq:p=1}.  The variations in $\phi_0$ with $\frac{E_{th}}{E}$ give an Arnold tongue's shaped diagram. 

The presence of mobile ions in the BZ reaction causes the excitation waves in the medium to respond uniquely with an applied electric field. A systematic study of this interaction will provide new insights into the control and applications of the chemical waves.

\iffalse
The field-induced motion of $Br^-$ ions in the BZ reaction forces the core of a free spiral to drift toward the anode. An equivalent electric force induces retardation in the propagation of a pinned spiral, which eventually leads to its unpinning and a further drift similar to that of a free spiral. The retarding electric force can drag the spiral wave and cause unpinning only if it possesses a threshold amplitude. 
For any field strength greater than the threshold, the unpinning occurs when the electric field component along the tangential direction of spiral propagation reaches the critical threshold. This assumption leads to the deduction of conditions for the unpinning phase window.
According to this, the quantities pacing ratio, initial spiral phase, and field strength provide sensitive control over unpinning. It is interesting to notice the unpinning with an electric field of lower frequency than the spiral wave in the BZ reaction. Unpinning is also possible for a unit pacing ratio with a particular set of initial phases. 

It is evident from the study that the process of unpinning is not instantaneous with the application of the field. Instead, it requires a minimum duration of interaction between the spiral and the field, which is decided by other parameters such as the pacing ratio, initial spiral phase, and field strength.
The presence of mobile ions in the BZ reaction causes the excitation waves in the medium to respond uniquely with an applied electric field. A systematic study of this interaction will provide new insights into the control and applications of the chemical waves.
